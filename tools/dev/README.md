# Development helpers

This folder collects one-off maintenance scripts and archived assets that are **not** part of the firmware:

- `_tmp_*.py` scripts were used during Wi-Fi portal refactors. They are kept for reference only and are not executed by the build.
- `unused/` holds legacy or experimental files that are intentionally excluded from the firmware.

None of the content here is required to build or run the project. Keep new temporary scripts in this directory so they do not clutter the root and are easy to ignore in version control.
